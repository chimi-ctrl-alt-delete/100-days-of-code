# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started reading HTML & CSS design and build websites by Jon Duckett. I got through the Introduction, Chapter 1 Structure, and Chapter 2 Text. I coded along with all reference examples provided. The introduction was a rundown of the book, letting me know what to expect. Chapter 1 gave you the structure of a  basic HTML file. Chapter 2 we covered text, by using structured HTML and semantic HTML to give the content the right representation.

**Thoughts:** A refresher of the fundamentals was nice.
