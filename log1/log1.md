# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started reading HTML & CSS design and build websites by Jon Duckett. I got through the Introduction, Chapter 1 Structure, and Chapter 2 Text. I coded along with all reference examples provided. The introduction was a rundown of the book, letting me know what to expect. Chapter 1 gave you the structure of a  basic HTML file. Chapter 2 we covered text, by using structured HTML and semantic HTML to give the content the right representation.

**Thoughts:** A refresher of the fundamentals was nice.

### Day 1: May 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got one chapter done today List in my current book. 

**Thoughts:** Got inspired by a twitter post from Kyle Prinsloo: 

> My first client was a $5 Fiverr sale.
> 
> That turned into a $100 Wireframe.
> 
> That turned into a $1,000 Website.
> 
> That turned into Referral Clients.
> 
> All from this ONE client.
> 
> Start "small" 
> Thumbs up
 
Schedule adjustments need to be made for productivity.
